# travel-blog-landing-page

Landing page project as part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum, there is more to it than was asked for (js included).

Learned to do:

- general reset, based on Piccadilli
- little bit of accessability basics
- basic css abstraction
- media query for mobile
- use of css variables
- use of css pseudoelements
- embeding video
- use of google fonts
- use of css grid
- use of js toggle
- use of data types
- change nav bar layout for small screen
- creating overlay
- clickable overlay

Issues:

- little slow > possibly make image resolution smaller?
  (- all images are downloaded)
- more & improved css vars next time
- title bg has overlay of body bg, z-index doesn't solve.
- no templating, however this is single page website so isn't needed
  (- no content, but that's fine)
